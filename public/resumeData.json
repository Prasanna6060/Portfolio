    "bio": "Hi there! I’m Prasanna Khanal — a Full Stack Developer who eats, sleeps, and breathes code. With years of experience turning ideas into scalable digital products, I’ve worked with startups and solo projects, building everything from slick React frontends to powerful backend systems with Node and MongoDB. Along the way, I found my real passion: helping others grow as developers.Whether it’s solving real-world problems, sharing insights, or building cool projects, I’m all about delivering real value. Through hands-on tutorials and clear guidance, I help upcoming devs gain the skills and confidence they need to crush it in the real world.
